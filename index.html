      <h2 class="title">Quitting my job and moving to Chicago</h2>
      <p class="description">Quitting my job and moving to Chicago was a big deal. It was in with the new and out with the old. I've learned new skills, met cool people, and the drive from NC was pretty memorable.</p>

      <p class="description">I was just sitting in this bar/restaurant when a storm trooper walked in the front door. He walked around, conversed with some patrons, and then calmly left. Not before several photo opportunities, though.</p>

      <p class="description">I bought an upright bass in 2013. It was an investment that I immediately deemed worthwhile. Its been a fun thing to explore in my free time, but not a fun thing to carry around.</p>
